    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      In the world of software development, there's a profound difference between code that works and code that tells
      a story. While any programmer can make a computer execute instructions, the true artistry lies in crafting code
      that speaks to its readers, revealing its purpose and design with the clarity of well-written prose.
    </p>

    <h2 id="poetry-modern-cpp" class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12">The Poetry of Modern C++</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      Modern C++ has evolved into a language that allows us to express complex ideas with remarkable elegance. It's no
      longer just about managing memory and optimizing performance—it's about capturing intent and design in a way that
      feels almost poetic. Consider this evolution in how we express a simple filtering operation:
    </p>
    <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
      <pre class="language-cpp"><code>
// The old way: terse but cryptic
vector<int> f(vector<int>& v, int t) {
    vector<int> r;
    for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
        if(v[i] > t) r.push_back(v[i]);
    }
    return r;
}

// The modern way: clear, expressive, intentional
vector<int> filterElementsAboveThreshold(const vector<int>& values,
                                       const int threshold) {
    vector<int> filteredElements;
    copy_if(values.begin(), values.end(),
           back_inserter(filteredElements),
           [threshold](int value) { return value > threshold; });
    return filteredElements;
}
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      The transformation is striking. The modern version doesn't just perform the same operation—it tells us what it's
      doing and why. Each identifier is chosen with purpose, each operation reveals its intent.
    </p>

    <h2 id="smart-pointers" class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12">Characters in Our Story: Smart Pointers</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      In any good story, characters need clear arcs and well-defined relationships. In C++, our objects are our characters,
      and smart pointers help us tell their stories with clarity and precision. They're not just tools for preventing
      memory leaks—they're a way of expressing ownership and lifecycle in code.
    </p>
    <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
      <pre class="language-cpp"><code>
class DataProcessor {
private:
    struct ProcessingContext {
        string_view name;
        vector<double> data;
    };

    unique_ptr<ProcessingContext> context;

public:
    void initializeProcessing(string_view processorName,
                            vector<double> initialData) {
        context = make_unique<ProcessingContext>(
            ProcessingContext{processorName, move(initialData)}
        );
    }

    bool hasActiveContext() const {
        return context != nullptr;
    }
};
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      Here, unique_ptr tells us a story about ownership. It makes it clear that DataProcessor has exclusive ownership
      of its context, and that context has a lifecycle tied directly to its owner. This isn't just about memory
      management—it's about expressing relationships and responsibilities in code.
    </p>

    <h2 id="templates" class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12">Plot Patterns: The Art of Templates</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      Great stories often follow recognizable patterns while remaining unique in their details. Templates in C++ serve
      a similar purpose—they're reusable plot structures that can be filled with different characters while maintaining
      their narrative integrity. The Observer pattern provides a perfect example:
    </p>
    <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
      <pre class="language-cpp"><code>
template<typename T>
class Observable {
private:
    unordered_set<function<void(const T&)>> observers;

public:
    void addObserver(function<void(const T&)> observer) {
        observers.insert(move(observer));
    }

    void notify(const T& value) {
        for (const auto& observer : observers) {
            observer(value);
        }
    }
};

class TemperatureSensor : public Observable<double> {
public:
    void measureTemperature() {
        double newTemperature = getCurrentTemperature();
        notify(newTemperature);  // Our plot point
    }
};
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      This code tells a story about communication and relationships. The template provides the structure, while the
      specific implementations add the details that make each story unique.
    </p>

    <h2 id="raii" class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12">Setting the Scene: RAII</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      Every story needs a well-defined world with clear rules. In C++, RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
      provides these rules, creating a predictable universe where resources are managed automatically and reliably.
    </p>
    <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
      <pre class="language-cpp"><code>
class DatabaseConnection {
private:
    sqlite3* db;

public:
    DatabaseConnection(string_view connectionString)
        : db(nullptr) {
        if (sqlite3_open(connectionString.data(), &db) != SQLITE_OK) {
            throw DatabaseException("Failed to open database");
        }
    }

    ~DatabaseConnection() {
        if (db) {
            sqlite3_close(db);
        }
    }

    // Our story's rules about copying and moving
    DatabaseConnection(const DatabaseConnection&) = delete;
    DatabaseConnection& operator=(const DatabaseConnection&) = delete;
    DatabaseConnection(DatabaseConnection&& other) noexcept
        : db(exchange(other.db, nullptr)) {}
};

void processUserData() {
    DatabaseConnection conn("users.db");  // Beginning
    // Middle
} // End - automatic cleanup
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      This code doesn't just manage resources—it tells a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The rules of our
      universe (RAII) ensure that every resource follows this narrative structure.
    </p>

    <h2 id="conclusion" class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12">The Never-Ending Story</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      Writing code that tells a story isn't about following a set of rigid rules—it's about understanding that every
      piece of code we write becomes part of a larger narrative. When we approach coding as storytelling, we create
      systems that are not just functional, but comprehensible, maintainable, and even beautiful.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      Remember: the code you write today will be read many times before it's rewritten. Make it a story worth reading.
    </p>
