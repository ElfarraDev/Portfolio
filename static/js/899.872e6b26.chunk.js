Use comments only when necessary.</li>\n      <li>Formatting: Consistent formatting improves code readability and maintainability.</li>\n      <li>Objects and Data Structures: Hide internal structure and expose behavior.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Favorite Quotes</h2>\n    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 mb-6 italic">\n      "The only way to go fast is to go well."\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 mb-6 italic">\n      "Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares."\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Personal Reflections</h2>\n    <p class="mb-4">\n      Reading "Clean Code" has significantly influenced my approach to software development. I\'ve learned to prioritize code readability and maintainability, understanding that code is read far more often than it is written.\n    </p>\n    <p class="mb-4">\n      One of the most impactful lessons for me was the importance of writing small, focused functions. This practice has not only made my code more modular and easier to test but has also improved my problem-solving skills by encouraging me to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Moving forward, I\'m committed to applying these principles in my daily coding practices, continuously refining my skills to write cleaner, more efficient code.\n    </p>\n  '}}}]);
